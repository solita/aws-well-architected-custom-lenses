# AWS Well Architected custom lenses

Some AWS Well Architected lenses exist solely as whitepapers but reviews are conducted better with the WA tool. This project contains some custom lenses created from AWS whitepapers. Each invidivual lens can be found under *lenses* in their own subdirectory.

## Disclaimer
- The whitepapers don't always adhere to the question-choice format of the WA tool, so some of the choices have been inferred from the questions.
- The whitepapers don't define what combination of choice produces a HIGH or MEDIUM risk. These have been chosen by us, but adjust them to your case if necessary.
